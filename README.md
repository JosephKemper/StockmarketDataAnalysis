# Overview

For this project, I will be analyzing Historical Tesla stock data. I got the data from the Nasdaq Stock website and downloaded all of their available data on Tesla as of 1 November 2023. You can find a link to the data in the [useful websites](#useful-websites) section. 

A huge portion of the reason I am doing this project is pure unadulterated curiosity. I find analyzing things fun. Another, and probably more important reason is to showcase my skills. This is a project, that I will have a lot of fun with. I chose Tesla for the simple reason that it is a company I am familiar with. 

At minimum, I will research 2 questions about the data, however one challenge I will very likely have is limiting myself to a reasonable number of questions to research.
